# Contributing to QuickEx Frontend

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the QuickEx frontend!

## Development Workflow

1.  **Branching**: Create a feature branch for your changes (e.g., `feat/add-wallet-connect`).
2.  **Code Style**: We use ESLint and Prettier. Run `pnpm lint` before committing.
3.  **Type Safety**: Ensure all changes pass TypeScript checks with `pnpm type-check`.
4.  **Testing**: Add unit tests for new components or logic where applicable.

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Branch is up-to-date with `main`.
- [ ] No linting or type-check errors.
- [ ] All tests pass locally.
- [ ] README is updated if necessary.
- [ ] Descriptive commit messages.

## UI Guidelines

- Use **Tailwind CSS** for all styling.
- Follow the **vibrant dark theme** (neutral-950 background, indigo-500 accents).
- Ensure all interactive elements have hover and focus states.
- Maintain a **premium, clean aesthetic** with consistent spacing and typography.
